<h1>CIS 457 Lab 8: Router Operation</h1>


<hr>

<p>In class, we brifly discussed routing tables. These are usually implemented using some variant of the Trie data structure. In lab we will discuss the multibit trie data structure. <b>This lab may be done in groups of at most two students. You may work alone if you choose to.</b>

<p><b>What to turn in:</b> You must turn in your code on blackboard. Additionally, you must demo your program on 4/17/12 in lab. If you do not demo, you will recieve no credit for this assignment.

<hr>

<p>In this assignment, you must implement longest prefix match routing
using a multibit trie. To get any credit for this assignment, you must
use a trie. Implementing this program in any other way will result in
score of 0.Your program should take as input two files (specified on
the command line) as described below.

<p>The first file will be the list of possible routes. Each line in
this file will consiste of an IP prefix, and next hop router. A sample
is available <a href="bgpsample.txt">here.</a> A different file will
be provided for use when demoing. This file will only contain one next
hop for each prefix (while normally a router would look at the AS path
and choose which next hop to use for each prefix, this step is already
taken care of for you).

<p>The second file will be a list of IP addresses. Your program should
look up each address in the file, perform the longest prefix match,
and output the IP address of the next hop router that packets destined
to this IP address should be sent to.

<p>You must write this program in Java, C, or C++. You may not use any
non-standard libraries without permission, nor use any existing trie
implmentations available online.

<p><b>To get a C:</b> Implement the specification described above,
using a multibit trie with a fixed stride length of 2.

<p><b>To get a B:</b> Make the stride length adjustable. You must
support stride lengths of 1 - 4. It is fine for the stride length to
be specified at startup, or to make it require a recompile to adjust
the length. If it requires a recompilation, you must be able to adjust
the length by editing at most a single line of code.

<p><b>To get an A:</b> Implement everything necessary for a
B. Additionally, add code to your program to time the lookups (in
java, you should use System.nanoTime()). You should make your best
effort to only include the trie lookups and nothing else in this
measurement (no trie building, file reading, etc). Measure and graph
the average trie lookup time (over lookups of at least 1000 random IP
addresses that match prefixes other than 0.0.0.0/0) for your program
with stride lengths of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Extra points will be awarded to
the group with the fastest average lookups (with whatever stride
length is best) using a Java program, and the fastest with a C/C++
program. A smaller amount of extra points will be awarded to any
groups within 10% of the fastest.
